I'll give you a little "roadmap", since there really isn't one online and finding the right resources was one of the hardest things about learning to reverse lol;
Intro to x86 (very important): https://opensecuritytraining.info/IntroX86.html
Intro to reverse engineering (Also a really good class, and doing the lab was very fun): https://opensecuritytraining.info/IntroductionToReverseEngineering.html
After that, you'll have basic reversing knowledge and you have a solid basis on the x86 architecture. The next part's the hardest; after these 2 intro courses, you won't really know what to do next, since you're not really experienced enough to start reversing real life applications probably. I have 2 suggestions; 1. do reversing challenges in ctfs, and 2. go through the book "Practical malware analysis", and ACTUALLY do the labs. Yes, it's about malware reversing, and maybe you're not interested in that, but it gives you a good basis in reversing Windows applications which is a whole other beast in and of itself, and it gives you fun, practical things to reverse, which isn't always easy to find. As always, take your time with this, don't try to rush it, have fun.

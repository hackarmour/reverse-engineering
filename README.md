# binary-exploitation
So, Binary exploitation has piqued your interest. Great! I myself am a big fan (Something about staring at raw assembly for hours together really engages me).
In this repo, you will find all the resources that I've personally used, as well as some which are worth mentioning.

If you are a *complete* beginner with no prior experience (with "hacking", CTFs, or linux), and want to get started with binary exploitation, I can't recommend LiveOverflow's binary exploitation enough (This was my absolute starting point!) -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyAyN3GFM7A&list=PLhixgUqwRTjxglIswKp9mpkfPNfHkzyeN.

TL;DR?
1) You may want to start using a linux based operating system (I recommend Ubuntu!), but this is not a necessity. You can get by just fine using Windows (And if you're using Mac, there's no reason to switch at all!). But keep in mind that setting up some things on Windows is a pain, and you may have to search the internet for answers.

2) Understand code! (Notice, I said *understand*, knowing how to write code is not a prerequisite, although you definitely will be better off if you are familiar with some fundamental concepts). What I mean by this is, spend some time with simple programs. Compile them, and reverse their executables. Understand the flow of execution. This is very important, as you can't get far without this basic understanding.

Stay tuned to this repo for more, cheers!
